Trace fruits is a conceptual demo to visualise fruits supply chain events stored in an immutable ledger.  It uses splunk to analyse 
generated data from hyperledger-fabric's blockchain ledgers.


This demo concept picked from the GS1 global traceability standard, that provides guidelines on fresh fruit and vegetable 
traceability. It includes following major supply chain events for traceability : 

-  Harvesting - The producer harvests the crop and packs the products into in cases. 
-  Packing/Repacking - The packer/repacker transforms ungraded commodities into products. 
-  Shipping - The packer/repacker palletizes the cases of product.
-  Transporting - The carrier arrives and loads the pallets onto the truck. 
-  Receiving - The pallets arrive in the retailer or foodservice operatorâ€™s distribution centre.
-  Selling or Consumption - The products have arrived at the retail store and have been placed on the shelves.

A trace-id is unique for set of product's supply chain events. 

#### Demo Recording

#### How conceptually it works ?

- In every logical step of fruits supply chain, a fresh fruit supply chain event with unique trace-id got inserted into the blockchain ledger e.g.
harvesting event or shipping event. This event contains most important logical information to identify and prove this 
supply chain event.

- The inserted unique trace-ids relates to a batch of fruits products, and that trace-id inserted on each and every event
from start to finish of that batch of fruits products e.g. from harvesting to retail. 

- A complete audit trail of events from start to finish can be queried from ledger via trace-id 

- Individuals events can be queried from ledger 

- events inserted along the way of supply chain 


#### How To 

##### Step-1 : Clone this repository to linux flavour machine e.g.  Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS

##### Step-2 : Install Prerequisites of hyperledger fabric 

##### Step-3 : Install Samples, Binaries, and Docker Images 

Execute the command to pull down the binaries and images

```
curl -sSL http://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s -- 1.4.6 1.4.6 0.4.18
```

- hyperledger/fabric-baseos 0.4.18
- hyperledger/fabric-ca 1.4.6
- hyperledger/fabric-orderer 1.4.6
- hyperledger/fabric-peer 1.4.6


##### Step-5 : Setup network, necessary dockers  , orgs, peer , channels , Splunk 

Inside this repo, call start shell script. It will setup necessary dockers images e.g. couch, 
Splunk, fabric network, orgs, peers, channels

```
./start.sh

```

![After a successful run of start.sh](/images/Start-sh-successful-output.png)


##### Step-6 : Run init ledgers from command line 

````
./init_ledgers.sh
````  

It will insert 18 supply events into the via trace_fruits_cc chaincode to the ledgers.

##### Step-7 : Open couchdb Fauxton , a native web-based interface built into CouchDB :

````
http://<ip address>:5984/_utils/
````   

 Click on databases 
 Click on fruitsreceiver_trace_fruits_cc

 ![After a successful init of events in world state](/images/A-recordin-couch-db.png)


##### Step-9 : Run Send Txns to continuously send events to Trace Fruits ledgers

````
./send_txns.sh
````

![After a successful run of send txns](/images/Send-Txns-Successfully-Sending-Events.png)

##### Step-10 : Open splunk enterprise :
 
 ```
 http://<ip-address>:8000/en-US/account/login 
 
 username : admin 
 Password : changeme 
  
 if local then ip address is 127.0.0.1 
 ```  
 
 Open Splunk App for Hyperledger Fabric 
 Click on Trace Fruits On the Side Bar

###### To shutdown the environment 

`./stop.sh`.

 ##### Note
 
 - .checkpoints is an empty file -> ./.checkpoints:/usr/src/app/.checkpoints in docker-compose-splunk.yaml
 - splunk-apps is an empty dir   -> - ./splunk-apps:/opt/splunk/etc/apps in docker-compose-splunk.yaml
 - trace-fruits-apps contains trace-fruits splunk app available tar.gz, and a regular folder
 - trace-fruits chaincode available in trace-fruits-cc directory
 - trace-fruits-splunk-app.tar.gz also available in s3 https://trace-fruits.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/trace-fruits-splunk-app.tar.gz
 - Audit trail query is not implemented yet
 - Tar file of Trace-Fruits-1 doesn't work if created from mac,
